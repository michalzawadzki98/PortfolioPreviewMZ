            <h1>üöÄ Challenge</h1>
            <p>L'Or√©al Paris and Saint-Gobain organized a hackathon with the aim of developing concepts for innovative solutions to challenges in the Construction & Beauty-Tech industries. The challenge presented to our team was <b>"How can we increase the number of consumers for the official L'Or√©al store on the largest Polish marketplace (Allegro)?"</b></p>

        <h1>üí¢ Research & Problem Statement</h1>
        <p>Customers purchasing beauty products online face the challenge of finding the right product that meets their specific needs. <b>The vast array of available products can be overwhelming for buyers, and the product selection process takes a considerable amount of time</b>. Customers buying beauty products often lack sufficient knowledge about conscious skincare, making it difficult for them to choose the right product.</p>
        <p><b>The issue of dissatisfaction and difficulty in finding the desired product ranks among the top 5 most commonly mentioned problems </b> that consumers encounter during online shopping.</p>
        <p>The presence of a wide range of products beyond cosmetics on Allegro further complicates the beauty product shopping experience, leading consumers to prefer other platforms. All of this contributes to the fact that shopping for beauty products on the Allegro marketplace is not very popular among consumers. <b>This, in turn, results in low sales for the official L'Or√©al store on Allegro.</b></p>

            <h1>üí° Generating Ideas & Selection</h1>
            <p>Taking into account the business requirements and the problems defined based on research and user interviews, we proceeded to generate ideas. Each team member independently generated solution ideas using the Crazy Eights method. Subsequently, we engaged in a collaborative ideation session, we additionally utilized ChatGPT to generate more ideas.</p>
              
            <p>We evaluated the best ideas based on their uniqueness and how well they addressed real user problems.</p>
              
            <p><b>We concluded that the best idea was to create an intelligent cosmetics selection assistant. Through asking relevant questions and leveraging modern technologies such as skin scanning based on photos, it would tailor the perfect product for the consumer's needs.</b> Consequently, it would guide them to the official L'Or√©al store on Allegro, where the consumer could purchase the recommended product.</p>         
              
         <p>The assistant was envisioned as a web application, accessible by navigating to a dedicated website, for example, through a link. The assistant could be integrated with the Allegro website (in case of collaboration between L'Or√©al and Allegro). It would not require the installation of an application or the registration of an account.</p>

    <h1>üéÆ Prototyping & Testing</h1>
    <p>After selecting and discussing the idea in terms of the functionalities it should include, I created user interface mockups and an interactive prototype in Figma.</p>
    <p><b>Since the assistant is intended to be a simple application, and I can quickly create high-fidelity mockups, I decided not to create low-fidelity mockups. In my opinion, this streamlines the testing process and helps the user better understand the tested prototype.</b> When creating the mockups, I based them on the style of the Allegro service, as there is the possibility of integrating this tool directly with that service.</p>

      <p>For example: if the average basket value in the L'Or√©al store on Allegro is around 100 PLN, and the store has approximately 5,000 orders per month, the assistant could increase monthly sales by the value of 50,000 - 75,000 PLN.</p>

<p><b>Considering these factors, there is a genuine opportunity for collaboration between L'Or√©al and Allegro in implementing the assistant and integrating it directly into the Allegro platform.</b></p>
<p><b>However, if Allegro is unwilling to collaborate in this regard, the assistant can be developed as a standalone application</b> on a dedicated domain not directly linked to Allegro. There are numerous promotion possibilities for this tool to achieve its objectives both in collaboration with Allegro and independently as part of L'Or√©al's initiatives.</p>

    <p>The project was carried out during 6 sessions of Design Thinking meetings. <b>The project implementation took approximately 30 hours, including the creation of an interactive prototype and the preparation of an investor presentation.</b></p>
    <p>The final of the hackathon took place on December 1, 2023, in Warsaw, with the participation of 10 teams. <b>Our team secured the 3rd place, and the developed solution in the form of an Intelligent Cosmetics Selection Assistant received positive feedback from the jury, including experts from L'Or√©al.</b></p>
    <p>I believe that the assistant has tremendous potential and numerous possibilities for further development.</p>
